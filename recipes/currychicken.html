    <h3>Mama Myah strikes back with her world famous curry chicken...</h3>
    <p>While curry might not sound like the typical dinner rut for some, whenever I’m not sure what to cook and need an easy meal (soooo almost every night), curry is one of my defaults: Thai Chicken Curry, Slow Cooker Chicken Curry, and Coconut Curry are three frequent menu items.</p>
    <p>The sauce is thick and rich, so this curry is comforting on a chilly evening if that’s when you are craving it, but the spices also work surprisingly well on even the hottest summer day. I suspect that’s why curry is so popular in countries known for their warm climates, like India and the Caribbean.This is an adapted, easy-ingredient version of traditional Jamaican curry chicken. If you want authentic flavor, made over to be healthy and done with ingredients you can find at the average American supermarket, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oi.</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion.</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper.</li>
        <li>2 jalapeno peppers.</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger.</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tablespoons curry powder.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric.</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon allspice.</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>2 medium Yukon gold potatoes.</li>
        <li>1 15-ounce can light coconut milk.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white wine vinegar.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh cilantro.</li>
        <li>Pre-prepared brown rice.</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken with salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a Dutch oven or similar deep, sturdy pot, heat the oil over medium. Once it is hot, add the onions, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions begin to soften and turn translucent, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the red bell pepper, jalapeños, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add curry powder, turmeric, allspice, and cayenne. Cooking, stirring constantly, until spices turn deep gold and become ultra fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring often. It should look golden on the outside but does not need to be completely cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes. Cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk, Worcestershire, vinegar, and hot sauce. Stir to combine. Bring to a simmer. Continue to simmer, reducing the heat to low as needed, until the chicken is tender and cooked through, the potatoes are tender, and sauce has slightly reduced, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir every few minutes to keep the sauce from sticking.</li>
        <li>Taste and season with additional salt or hot sauce as desired. Serve hot over rice, with a big sprinkle of cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
